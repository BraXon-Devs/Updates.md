### **POSTED** 3/28/2021 @ 4:08 AM EST

Next week we're planning to deploy the 3.13.1e update with a fair amount of improvements and bug fixes. Today we're prepared a preview of its patch notes to give you an idea of what to expect. Check them out below!

`Please note that the patch notes listed below might be changed prior to any other updates or releases of the 1.01 patch.`

#### General Improvements
- We have updated and reworked our Github Server and some to all of the backlinks ([https://github.com/CraftyDevelopers](https://github.com/CraftyDevelopers "https://github.com/CraftyDevelopers"))
- We will soon start our website using Wordpress from [Wordpress.org](https://wordpress.org "Wordpress.org") to have a fully customizable community. However, the frontend will be in HTML Javascript and PHP while our back-end will be using PHP and MySQLDB.
- There was a general cleaning around the Discord Server, I hope you like it! Of course suggestions are welcomed as well! https://github.com/CraftyDevelopers/Updates/issues/new <-- be sure to change the Lable to the right to ***Suggestion***

#### Noteworthy
- We now own craftydevs.net
- Our github repo links has been updated all around: you can catch the link a few lines up or just follow this update which is already linked too and from
- We finally got a facebook page and is updated since we purchased craftydevs.net. That alone was helpful for the facebook page due to both Title and Username issues in which was resolved 2 hours before this update.
